# serofyte.net-redirect
How I redirect things with my custom domain. Some links redirect to ~~tinyurl~~ rb.gy to count link clicks for my curiosity.
Because of how the redirecting works (read 404.html), javascript needs to be enabled.

note: fuck tinyurl they removed the ability to see link clicks for free
